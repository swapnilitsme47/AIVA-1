# AIVA-1


I started this project as a college project in early 2018, and due to certain busyness, was not being able to commit into this.

This is a simple virtual assistant named Jessica, which can perform simple instructions. 

I have decided to involve AI, ML and NLP in this to make it more robust and amazing in the upcoming time.


Till then, let it be and if someone wants to commit changes, it will be very awesome.

Lets build together something amazing.
